/* let x = 2 + '2'; you would get 22

let x = 2 + 2 + '2'; you would get 42

let x = 2 + true; you would get 3 boecasue true is boolean either 1 or 0

let x = 2 + true + '2'; you would get 32 because of previous reasons

let x = true + '2'; you would get 'true2'  */


//let x = Number('2'); you could only assign a number becuase the cmd is Number

//let x = Boolean(1); you would get true because any number is true and 0 is flase


/* let x = '';
if (x)   {
 
}  give you true

if ([]); this would give you true becuase it is an array */
